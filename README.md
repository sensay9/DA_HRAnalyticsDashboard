Welcome to the HR Analytics Dashboard project! This repository hosts an interactive dashboard designed to provide insights into HR metrics and employee attrition.</br>

## Overview
The Human Resources Analytics Dashboard offers key performance indicators (KPIs) related to employee count, attrition, attrition rate, average age of employees, average salary, and average years of employee attrition. Users can filter data by different departments, such as Human Resources, Research and Development, and Sales, to analyze trends and patterns within specific areas of the organization.</br>

## Features
- **Employee Count**: Provides a snapshot of the total number of employees in the organization.</br>
- **Attrition**: Displays the number of employees who have left the company during a specified period.</br>
- **Attrition Rate**: Calculates the percentage of employees who have left the company relative to the total workforce.</br>
- **Average Age of Employee**: Presents the average age of employees in the organization.</br>
- **Average Salary**: Shows the average salary of employees across different departments.</br>
- **Average Years for Employee Attrition**: Indicates the average tenure of employees who have left the company.</br>

## Data Visualization</br>
The dashboard utilizes various data visualization techniques, including pie charts, bar diagrams, and graphs, to present HR metrics in a visually engaging manner. These visualizations offer insights into employee demographics, attrition trends, and departmental performance.

## Data Cleaning and Transformation</br>
To ensure data accuracy and reliability, the project employs different processes for data cleaning and transformation. The Power Query Editor and DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) are utilized to clean, reshape, and enhance the raw data, ensuring that it is suitable for analysis and visualization.
