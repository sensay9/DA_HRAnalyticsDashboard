Welcome to the HR Analytics Dashboard project! This repository hosts an interactive dashboard designed to provide insights into HR metrics and employee attrition.</br>

## Overview
The HR Analytics Dashboard offers key performance indicators (KPIs) related to employee count, attrition, attrition rate, average age of employees, average salary, and average years of employee attrition. Users can filter data by different departments, such as Human Resources, Research and Development, and Sales, to analyze trends and patterns within specific areas of the organization.</br>

## Features
- **Employee Count**: Provides a snapshot of the total number of employees in the organization.</br>
- **Attrition**: Displays the number of employees who have left the company during a specified period.</br>
- **Attrition Rate**: Calculates the percentage of employees who have left the company relative to the total workforce.</br>
- **Average Age of Employee**: Presents the average age of employees in the organization.</br>
- **Average Salary**: Shows the average salary of employees across different departments.</br>
- **Average Years for Employee Attrition**: Indicates the average tenure of employees who have left the company.</br>

## Data Visualization</br>
The dashboard utilizes various data visualization techniques, including pie charts, bar diagrams, and graphs, to present HR metrics in a visually engaging manner. These visualizations offer insights into employee demographics, attrition trends, and departmental performance.

## Data Cleaning and Transformation</br>
To ensure data accuracy and reliability, the project employs different processes for data cleaning and transformation. The Power Query Editor and DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) are utilized to clean, reshape, and enhance the raw data, ensuring that it is suitable for analysis and visualization.

## Potential Data Analysis</br>
In addition to the existing features, the HR Analytics Dashboard presents opportunities for further data analysis and exploration. Some potential analysis areas regarding employee attrition include:</br>
- **Identifying Attrition Patterns**: Analyze historical attrition data to identify patterns or trends that may indicate factors contributing to employee turnover.</br>
- **Attrition Prediction**: Build predictive models to forecast employee attrition based on various factors such as demographics, job satisfaction, and performance metrics.</br>
- **Attrition by Department**: Explore attrition rates across different departments to understand variations and identify areas requiring attention or improvement.</br>
- **Gender-Based Attrition Analysis**: Investigate attrition rates based on gender to uncover any disparities or challenges faced by specific demographic groups.</br>

By leveraging these data analysis techniques, organizations can gain valuable insights into employee attrition patterns, enabling them to develop proactive strategies for talent retention and workforce management.
